•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
My app was a weight loss app that required a user to be able to log in, or create an account if they didn’t have a log in. Then I needed to store their user information locally in a 
SQL Lite table to be able to verify it was the correct user logging in. Next I created a screen that accepted the user’s weight as well displaying previous weights. There is an ability 
to receive an SMS notification is the user allowed it to notify them if they hit their goal weight. 
•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I needed three screens; a log in, a home, and a data screen for the weights. I provided a bottom navigation button to navigate between the screens. I kept everything simple and free of clutter.
•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I built the app feature by feature after create the skeleton of the screens. This aided me in testing it out to be sure new features didn’t break old one.
•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Testing was done in the Android Studio app with the debugger and with he emulator to ensure it functioned correctly.
•	Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had no school provided resources on the SMS portion of the app and had to seek outside help on that. It did not feel empowering. It felt like incomplete school resources.
•	In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was able to create a layout I was proud of essentially in a brand new programming language.
